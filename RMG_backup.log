    [SiH2][SiH3](17)
Added 0 new core reactions
Created 4 new edge reactions
    SiH4(1) + [SiH4](15) => SiH3SiH(7)
    SiH4(1) + [SiH4](15) => H(3) + [SiH2][SiH3](16)
    SiH4(1) + [SiH4](15) => H(3) + [SiH2][SiH3](17)
    SiH4(1) + [SiH4](15) => H2(5) + Si2H2(13)

After model enlargement:
    The model core has 10 species and 6 reactions
    The model edge has 11 species and 30 reactions
